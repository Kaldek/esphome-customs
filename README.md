## HZB-12B-B Ice Maker

This is a fairly popular ice maker, with a number of different design styles.  The code will likely work (along with your ESP8266) if the Ice Maker has the following characteristics:
- Power LED that flashes slowly when in Standby mode, and turns solid when on
- An Ice Full LED
- A Water Empty LED
- Separate LEDs for Small and Large ice
